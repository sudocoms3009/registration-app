# Faculty Registration App


This is a description of how the app will function.

When a user launches the app, the app will display a list of names all the faculties that are there at wits. A user can then select the faculty they wish to inquire about. After a faculty is selected, the app will take the user into the next page where a list of schools belonging to the selected faculty will be displayed. Similarly, a user will select the school to which they wish to inquire about and the modules grouped according to the year of study will be displayed. A user can now select and check if they are eligible to register for a particular module or modules depending on their academic record. There will be a functionality where a user can enter the modules they have passed for a certain academic year and the app will calculate the points they have so far, or even if they qualify to graduate. There will also be an admin side of the app where an administrator can update the rules and the points of modules should there be a change.
